Our goal in this project is to use a heuristic search algorithm called Beam Search and personal rankings of transitions to build an optimal playlist with an optimal set of transitions. We will be connecting to the Spotify API to get pre-built playlists and reorganizing them using our own Beam Search algorithm with customized transition score calculations."

    "\n",
    "The following descriptions come directly from Spotify's documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Danceabilitity\n",
    "\"Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy\n",
    "\"Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key\n",
    "\"The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### Liveness\n",
    "\"Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loudness\n",
    "\"The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "\"Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speechiness\n",
    "\"Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tempo\n",
    "\"The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valence\n",
    "\"A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acoustic\n",
    "\"A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\""

    "### Beam Search Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam Search is a heuristic algorithm that explores a graph by expanding only on the most promising of nodes. To summarize prior, a heuristic algorithm is an algorithm that prioritizes a near optimal solution based on a variety of specialized techniques. As a result, heuristic algorithms like Beam Search are greedy and prioritize a locally optimal solution trading accuracy for speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beam Search is a breadth search algorithm that generates all the current successors. Here is the general outline of our algorithm in terms of musical transitions: First, we will begin with a a singular node, containing a transition score of 0, current songs (which is empty to begin with), and a list of available songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, for each available song, we will evaluate a transition score from the last song of the current playlist to the available song selected. The way we evaluated transition scores for each song is done by scoring musical likeness between songs. We will then remove the available song from the available songs list and add it to the current songs list. We will add this transition score to the total score and store this iteration of current songs, transition score, available songs as a new node in our heap of nodes to be explored.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Once all available songs have been visited we will then remove from the heap of newly created nodes with some of the highest transition scores. We will now consider only a constant set of nodes (which are of the lowest scores).\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "We will repeat these steps until all available songs have been considered and a full playlist has been created. We will select the remaining node with the highest transition score, as this node contains the playlist with the heuristically determined optimal solution."

    "During the course of this project, we aimed to find an optimal sorting mechanism for reordering the Spotify playlist tracks. To achieve this goal, we developed an evaluation score function, which we tweaked iteratively using a combination of tests, intuition, and analysis. The following is an analysis of the process we went through to arrive at our final evaluation score function:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial function\n",
    "We started with a basic evaluation score function that considered a few track features. However, we quickly realized that this initial function did not produce satisfactory results in terms of reordering the playlist tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature analysis\n",
    "To improve our evaluation score function, we first analyzed the available track features in the dataset. We focused on those features that could have a significant impact on the listening experience, such as tempo, danceability, energy, and valence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature selection\n",
    "Based on our analysis, we selected a set of track features that we believed would contribute to a better listening experience. We then experimented with different combinations of these features to understand their relative importance in the evaluation score function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tweaking weights\n",
    "Once we had chosen the relevant features, we assigned weights to them in our evaluation score function. We tweaked these weights iteratively, running tests on different playlists to see how they affected the resulting track order. We adjusted the weights based on the test results and our intuition about the importance of each feature in the listening experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing\n",
    "To ensure the effectiveness of our evaluation score function, we ran multiple tests using different playlists with diverse characteristics. We compared the original track order to the reordered tracklist generated by our function, looking for improvements in the listening experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition and feedback\n",
    "Throughout the process, we also relied on our intuition and gathered feedback from users to understand how the reordered playlists aligned with their preferences. This information helped us further refine the weights and the overall evaluation score function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final function\n",
    "After numerous iterations, tests, and refinements, we arrived at an optimal evaluation score function that produced satisfactory results in terms of reordering the playlist tracks. This function was able to effectively balance the selected features, creating a more enjoyable listening experience for the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our iterative approach, involving feature analysis, feature selection, tweaking of weights, testing, and the incorporation of intuition and user feedback, helped us develop an optimal evaluation score function for reordering Spotify playlists. This function is capable of enhancing the listening experience and can be further refined or expanded upon as needed."
