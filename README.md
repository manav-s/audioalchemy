This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution for generating optimal setlists for music mixing by considering beat detection, mixability, and transitions between songs. The AI evaluates the quality of transitions based on various musical attributes and employs heuristic search methods to create setlists with maximum overall mixability scores. Once the optimal setlist is obtained, it can be used in conjunction with existing music libraries to create the actual mix.
